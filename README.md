# imgur-viewer
An imgur viewer that purposefully does not support animations. If the imgur url entered into the text field is for an animated image, the program will inform you and will not show the image. Note, the application does not support displaying animated images by design - even if the program didn't explicitly block them, it would only show the first frame and nothing more
